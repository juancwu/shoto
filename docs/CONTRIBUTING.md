## Contribution Guide

Welcome potential contributor! Glad that you have taken an instered in this little project of mine. You can contribute in the following ways:

- Create an issue - propose a new feature or report a bug.
- PRs - doc updates (at the moment, I can't create new api keys for Clerk T.T so features/bug fixes aren't possible)

## Branch Naming

> Make sure you always branch off from the main branch. The branch named prod is only for releases.

Please follow these naming conventions for the branch names :) .

- For new features use: feature/description-of-feature
- For bug fixes use: bugfix/bug-description
- For refactoring use: ref/refactor-what
- For documentation use: doc/description-of-doc

## PRs

> Currently there are no tests setup for the project but it is a work in progress!

As of now, make sure the target branch is `dev` and **NOT** `prod` or `main`. Also make sure that it is correctly
linked to the right issue.

All PRs will need to get an approval from one of the maintaners (just me atm T.T) before it is ready to merge.
